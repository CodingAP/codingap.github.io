                <p>
                    Hello all! This was my first set of challenges developed for
                    RazorHack 2024, and these were also the simplest. This was a
                    way to get a lot of ideas into the CTF because I didn&#39;t
                    have time to flesh these all out into their own challenges
                    (I also had to cut stuff like malware inspection and
                    virtualization, but I can explore those ideas for another
                    time).

                            We managed to recover most of the data, but we have
                            some files that got scrubbed of all the metadata! We
                            will have some of our team members try to remember
                            what the data is, but can you investigate the files
                            to see WHAT you can find?</strong

                    File forensics sounds a lot cooler than what it is here.
                    Most of the challenges consisted of trying to figure out
                    what the file format is and putting it through the correct
                    program to see what the flag should be. Similarly to

                    Basically, I created an image that had the flag, removed the
                    .png extension, and that was it. Most of the challenges can
                    be solved with <em>file</em> in Linux as most file formats
                    have bytes at the beginning as identification. I also tried
                    to make the storyline work throughout the challenges,
                    especially for the last challenge. The flag is
                    <strong>flag{oh_what_a_silly_guy_43782}</strong>.

                    This is one of the challenges that I wanted to expand upon,
                    but chose not to due to lack of time. LEGO has an app called
                    <a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page"
                        >stud.io</a
                    >
                    where you can create builds and instructions for those
                    builds so that you can create you own custom LEGO sets. Not
                    only is it fun to &quot;pirate&quot; LEGO sets and build
                    them digitally, but this can also create fun visuals. I
                    wanted a PDF file for these challenges, and I thought it
                    would be cute to see LEGO instructions instead of a simple
                    Word document or something like that. The flag is
                    <strong>flag{lego_is_fun_25539}</strong>.

                    A nested ZIP file was an obvious choice for this type of
                    challenge, especially if you choose to remove all the
                    extensions like I did. This was a little confusing to
                    create, especially since I couldn&#39;t rename files to the
                    same thing, but I made due. I also chose a British guy to
                    present this one because I thought it would be funny to
                    subvert the Russian nesting doll joke. Speaking of the
                    British guy, this was actually my character for the CTF. The
                    game masters decided to dress up as employees of this
                    fictitious company, and I wore a top hat and mustache (for
                    the start). Anyways, the flag is
                    <strong>flag{british_nesting_dolls_38472}</strong>.

                    I don&#39;t remember where I saw this, but this was a
                    previous challenge that I solved for another CTF. I liked it
                    enough to copy it over to this set of challenges my self.
                    All I did was using Tinkercad to create a 3D printable model
                    that consisted of the flag. Since I knew that it was easy to
                    see .gcode files online, I made a harder vector file
                    challenge later on as well. The flag is

                    I just thought it would be funny to hide something in a
                    Scratch project. People don&#39;t normally export them to
                    files, so this was just a fun fact type of challenge. The
                    Scratch exported file is actually a zip file with all the
                    content needed to run it. Because of this, I had to split up
                    the flag so that people couldn&#39;t just <em>grep</em> the
                    flag easily (I mean you still can, but it would be harder).
                    The flag is
                    <strong>flag{just_like_mom_makes_it_38219}</strong>.

                    I also saw this, but I remember getting it from picoCTF
                    because I thought it was cool how Git keeps track of stuff
                    not just using Github/Azure/Gitlabs, but how the git file
                    system works as well. It is also not a simple
                    <em>grep</em> either because I couldn&#39;t find the raw
                    text for the commit message anywhere. I just had to use
                    <em>git log</em> though to find the messages, so I think it
                    is worthy enough of a challenge. Fun fact: this is the same
                    repository as the current one used to store all the files
                    for the challenge. I decided to repurpose it instead of
                    deleting it. The flag is

                    Because I couldn&#39;t do a hackable game or a
                    virtualization challenge, I decided that this was the next
                    best thing. NES graphics are not that hard to understand
                    after watching a 2 hour video series about them, but if you
                    use YYCHR to view them, it makes it very easy to edit. I
                    also added different colors to the text so that if you
                    wanted to make a custom palette, you can! The flag is

                    I actually have been using SQLite in a couple of recent
                    projects because of how easy it is to setup. While it is not
                    the best in terms of enterprise software (I even poke fun of
                    that in the prose), hobby projects are a great fit for how
                    fast it is to setup and use. Anyways, this is just a .db
                    file with a table with 10000 entries. You have to find the
                    flag in a sea of <em>not the flag</em>&#39;s (tbf all you
                    need to do is ctrl-f &quot;flag{&quot;, sooooooo). The flag
                    is <strong>flag{billions_of_rows_49812}</strong>.

                    This was that harder vector challenge I mentioned earlier. I
                    actually wanted this to be the virtualization challenge,
                    where you had to recreate the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuadraScan"

                    instruction set to create a vector image, but I think that
                    would be way too difficult for a challenge like this
                    (although I am ready to implement something like that for a
                    different challenge). Instead, I just created a list of
                    points that the participant would have to parse and draw
                    manually, which is still more difficult that all the other
                    challenges as they actually have to program stuff. The flag
                    is
                    <strong>flag{despicable_me_16_is_the_best_38103}</strong>

                    The final challenge is one where I wanted to utilize all the
                    other challenges before. I was thinking metadata between the
                    9 previous files to construct one final file, but I
                    couldn&#39;t think of a clean way to do that. Instead, I
                    went with a final riddle that had to be constructed out of
                    all the previous proses. If you notice, there are words that
                    are CAPITALIZED, and if you put them together, you get

                    challenge after that as I thought it would be a nice ending.
