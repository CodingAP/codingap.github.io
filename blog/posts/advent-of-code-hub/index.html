                <p>
                    With December coming up, we get to reflect on the year
                    before. I have a lot of thoughts about those, but
                    considering this is a blog about my projects, I&#39;ll hold
                    on to those for therapy. The point of this post is to
                    announce my new hub for my Advent of Code puzzles! I put
                    about 2 days of work into it, so it may be buggy, but I am
                    proud of it.

                <p>
                    In the AOC Hub, you can see my solutions, writeups, and
                    visualizations for each day as well as track the number of
                    stars for each day. Each year for Advent of Code, I like to
                    revamp my tool suite for it and try to build off of it. My
                    first year was 2019, where I got the tail end of it and
                    didn&#39;t compete really; however, it made me want to try
                    for the full month. 2020 came around and (obviously) was a
                    weird year. But, and I say this with not much excitement,
                    there were some positives. I really focused my programming
                    skills and worked on some Advent of Code puzzles before
                    December to try and get warmed up. This is when I created my
                    first Advent of Code manager scripts, which just generated
                    files and allowed me to run them. It was janky and my
                    scripts were copied and ran without much standardization,
                    but it worked. Advent of Code 2020 hit and it was the most
                    fun I had with a coding-related event ever. Looking back on
                    it, I would still say it was better than 2021 or 2022, but
                    maybe that&#39;s the rose-tinted glasses on my face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, with Advent of Code 2021, I revamped the tools to
                    allow for automatic input fetching and puzzle run from a
                    command line tool. This heavily sped up my production and
                    the bulk of my puzzle solving was done this year. 2022 cam
                    around and I once again revamped with writeups and readmes,
                    being able to show and talk about my progress in text form.
                    For this year, Advent of Code 2023, I wanted to have a
                    front-end to show everything off. It just so happened that
                    recently, I made an upgrade to STEVE that allows for much
                    easier site generation (which created the blogs you are
                    reading right now), so I used that tool to create a
                    front-end. I was also inspired by
                    <a
                        href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/17lwl85/2023_day_29_ok_think_im_probably_ready_for_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button"
                        >this Reddit post</a
                    >
                    that has a full front-end that allowed to run different
                    inputs. I didn&#39;t need this much, but creating was is
                    there was fun. I took the look the Advent of Code made and
                    ran with it. Snowflakes, glowing links and stars, the
                    brackets around the links.
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    <a
                        href="https://github.com/CodingAP/advent-of-code"

                    >
                </div>
                <p>
                    In addition to the new front-end, a new set of tools was
                    also developed that runs more efficently and caches pretty
                    much everything, so it doesn&#39;t bother the AOC servers
                    more than an actual human would. I am also making a clean
                    sheet with the puzzles and resolving them with my current
                    knowledge. All my old code is backed up so it isn&#39;t
                    removed, but I always like seeing my progress of knowledge.
                </p>

                    Thanks everybody for reading! I&#39;m so excited for Advent
                    of Code 2023!
