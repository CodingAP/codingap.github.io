Hello everyone! I have finally completed the blog section of the website after over a year of not touching this website (which is a bit shameful honestly, but it's done now). Now my goals are to complete the embedded projects, which consists of adding code in **codingap.github.io-dev** to grab to code from GitHub and load it on the website. I also want to refresh the website so that it is fully mobile-compatible and where animations can shine (unless they are turned off for accessibilty). Besides the future, let me talk about where I have been.

After not uploading content for a while on YouTube, I have been hard at work at university; however, I find that the classes aren't as exciting as I want them to be. I would still consider myself in the introduction classes, which isn't a challenge as I have plenty of experience from being self-taught. I am mostly doing this for the paper degree at the end of the journey. That being said, the opportunities that I receive are quite good, so I can't complain too much. And it is very fun being in college, so there isn't much complaining besides the classes. That is why I fill my time with personal projects. Here are my current projects:

- **prsntly.live**: A virtual presentation tool that allows for slide control and drawing on mobile devices
- **steve**: A template engine using JavaScript to generate files
- **new-aoc**: My yearly tradition of revamping my Advent of Code repo

There is still plenty more to do, but I don't want to bog myself down with personal projects that I cannot finish and classwork that takes semester to work on. At the end of the day, I am still trying to learn more and find a future I can be satisfied with. In the meantime, I can work on writing more as it allows me to get my content out without a lot of video editing (which I have come to not enjoy as much). Thanks for the read!
