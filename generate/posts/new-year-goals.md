2024 has hit me like a truck, but I'm holding on to the front. Not to say that it has been difficult, but a new year brings new responsibilities that I am excited for, no doubt, but can still be a lot. However, I will still aspire to be the best developer I can be. Last year was very succesful as I completed my first internship with Netsmart, released my first bit of open source code with STEVE, and pushed my educational career even further (future ACM president here :)). For 2024, I intend for this year to be better than that. Giving myself expectations will be a tall order as I am not the best with sticking it out, but that is why I am writing this post. I will define my goals here in a public space so that I can be held accountable. It will be a list that has a checkbox next to it to establish if I completed it with a date. I don't have any rewards besides the dopamine rush I get. Here we go!
